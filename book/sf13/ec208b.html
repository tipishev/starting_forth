<pre>
[rtn] ( 1 1 0 ) ok
</pre>
 Oh yes, and an extra zero. Why?


<tr><td valign="top"> Theo:
<td> I'll show you.
<pre>
EX 2 ' ; CATCH .S [rtn] ( 2 -14 ) ok
</pre>
 If the extra number added by<tt> CATCH </tt>is zero, the operation was successful. 
 If the value is not zero, it's an error number.


<tr><td valign="top"> Leo:
<td> What did go wrong with this specific example?


<tr><td valign="top"> Theo:
<td> Try the example using<tt> EXECUTE </tt>instead.
<pre>
EX 2 ' ; EXECUTE .S [rtn]
 Compile-only word (message # -14)
</pre>

<tr><td valign="top"> Leo:
<td> Hm.
<br> (2 minutes of dead silence)
<br> The<tt> .S </tt>following<tt> EXECUTE </tt>has not executed, but the one after<tt> CATCH </tt>worked.


<tr><td valign="top"> Theo:
<td> Indeed. <tt>EXECUTE </tt>cops out. <tt>CATCH </tt>catches any errors and restores the stacks, i.e., makes sure they have the same depth before and after failed operations. <tt>CATCH </tt>also replaces the execution token of the failed word with the error number. Of course, after a successful operation the "allright zero" lands on top of the operation's results. You can verify that with<tt> EX 1</tt>.
<br> Next one:
<pre>
EX 3 s" DUP" ' EVALUATE CATCH .S
</pre>


<tr><td valign="top"> Leo:
<td> This does the same as example 1.
<pre>
[rtn] ( 3 3 0 ) ok
</pre>


<tr><td valign="top"> Theo:
<td> Right again. But what about this one:
<pre>
EX 4 S" fig" ' EVALUATE CATCH .S
</pre>


<tr><td valign="top"> Leo:
<td> That "<tt>fig</tt>" can not be evaluated, so in addition to the 4 there will be some error number on the stack.
<pre>
[rtn] ( 4 0 0 -61 ) ok
</pre>
 Where did those two zeros come from?

<tr><td valign="top"> Theo:
<td> You should realize that after an error the stack depth before and after<tt> CATCH </tt>must be the same.


<tr><td valign="top"> Leo:
<td> Oh, of course, the<tt> FIG</tt>-string was on stack. But why has it turned into<tt> 0 0 </tt>?
