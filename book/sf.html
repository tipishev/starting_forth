  <H1>Comments on the Web Edition</H1>

	<P> <I>Starting Forth</I>, First Edition is from 1981. These web pages were designed in 2003,
	    when it became apparent that SF would never be re-issued by <A HREF="http://www.forth.com">the copyright holder</A>. A small supply of 
	    about 500 books was all that was <A HREF="http://theforthsource.com/catalog.html">left</A>.
	
	<P> When you can get hold of the original, <B>do so</B>.

	<P> In this transcript Forth code has been ANSified. The samples should run on, <EM>at 
	    least</EM>, iForth and SwiftForth. Where necessary, statements that were valid in 1981 have been 
	    exchanged with statements more appropriate for 2003 (when this tribute was written). 
	    
	<P> <EM>Starting Forth</EM> is full of very difficult to reproduce graphics. These enormously enhance
	    the text's mnemonic value, and are invaluable for a first-time Forth user. I have therefore
	    added "substitute" graphic elements, roughly at the same spot where they are in the 
	    original. The original graphics are, of course, much better.

	<P> In this transcript I have assumed a 32-bit, byte-addressing Forth, with 8-bit characters. 
	    The address returned by <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">WORD</FONT> is assumed to be <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">HERE</FONT>. This allows the common trick of <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">ALLOT</FONT>ing
	    length of <I>str</I> <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">CHARS</FONT> after using <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">WORD</FONT> in order to compile string <I>str</I> to memory.
	    Multitasking issues are ignored (e.g. no <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&gt;TYPE</FONT>, just 
	    <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">TYPE</FONT>). Division is symmetric, not floored, and two's complement 
	    is assumed throughout. Most Forths should not have problems with this.
	    Chapter 7 exploits extended uses of number conversion. Some Forths are broken in this respect,
	    but iForth and SwiftForth do support these neat features.
