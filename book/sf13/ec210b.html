Wait a minute,<tt> STOP? </tt>is not a standard Forth word. Let's focus on that first.

<pre>Forth file: <a href="ec210.frt.html" target="_blank"> ec210.frt</a>
\ MANY TIMES (Albert Nijhof)

FORTH DEFINITIONS   DECIMAL
: STOP? ( -- true/false )
  KEY?
  DUP IF   DROP KEY
           BL OVER = IF DROP KEY THEN
           27 OVER = IF -28 THROW THEN
           BL &lt;>
      THEN ;

) 1000 MS STOP? . [rtn] ?
</pre>

   Gives zero. But enter the same again, and press another key immediately after the<tt> [rtn]</tt>. Three possibilities.
<ol>
 <li> You've pressed<tt> [Esc]</tt>: Forth protests and reacts with an error message. 
 <li> You pressed some other key, not<tt> [Esc]</tt>, not<tt> [Space]</tt>: Forth prints<tt> -1 </tt>(TRUE).
 <li> You pressed<tt> [Space]</tt>: Forth pauses, stops all action, and waits for another key.  Is this key a<tt> [Space] </tt>again, then the result is<tt> 0 </tt>(FALSE). After<tt> [Esc] </tt>Forth protests, and all other keys produce<tt> -1 </tt>(TRUE).
</ol>
<br> This seems terribly complicated, but it's quite natural when you get the hang of it. <tt>STOP? </tt>(as mentioned, not a standard Forth word) is used a lot in words like<tt> WORDS</tt>,<tt> SEE</tt>,<tt> DUMP</tt>, etc., words that produce text that can run off the screen. With<tt> STOP? </tt>it is possible to toggle output (temporarily) on and off, or to abort output completely.

<pre>
: MANY ( -- ) >IN @ STOP? AND >IN ! ;
</pre>

As long as<tt> STOP? </tt>produces zero,<tt> >IN </tt>is made zero: Forth is fooled, and 'thinks' it hasn't yet read the line, starting at the very first character again.
<br>
<br> With<tt> MANY</tt>, interactive loops are possible:
<pre>
) 888 . MANY DROP [rtn] ?
</pre>

   Utterly useless, but:

<pre>
) BL [rtn]
) DUP EMIT 1+ MANY DROP [rtn] ?
