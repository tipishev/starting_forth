<H1>6 Throw it for a Loop</H1>

        <P> In Chap. 4 we learned to program the computer to make "decisions" by branching to different
            parts of a definition depending on the outcome of certain tests. Conditional branching is one
            of the things that make computers as useful as they are.
        
        <P> In this chapter, we'll see how to write definitions in which execution can conditionally branch
            back to an earlier part of the same definition, so that some segment will repeat again and again.
            This type of control construct is called a "loop." The ability to perform loops is probably the 
            most significant thing that makes computers as powerful as they are. If we can program the computer
            to make out one payroll check, we can program it to make out a thousand of them.

        <P> For now we'll write loops that do simple things like printing numbers at your terminal. In later
            chapters, we'll learn to do much more with them.

<H2>Definite Loops -- <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT>...<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT></H2>

        <P> One type of loop structure is called a "definite loop." You, the programmer, specify the number
            of times the loop will loop. In Forth, you do this by specifying a beginning number and an
            ending number (in reverse order) before the word <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT>. Then you put
            the words which you want to have repeated between the words <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT> and
            <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT>. For example
<PRE>   : TEST   10 0 DO  CR ." Hello "  LOOP ;
</PRE>
            will print a carriage return and "Hello" ten times, because zero from ten is ten.
<PRE>
        TEST
        <U>Hello</U>
        <U>Hello</U>
        <U>Hello</U>
        <U>Hello</U>
        <U>Hello</U>
        <U>Hello</U>
        <U>Hello</U>
        <U>Hello</U>
        <U>Hello</U>
        <U>Hello ok </U>
</PRE>
        <P> Like an <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IF</FONT>...<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">THEN</FONT> statement, which also
            involves branching, a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT>...<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT> statement
            must be contained within a (single) definition.

        <P> The ten is called the "limit" and the zero is called the "index."
<PRE>   
        FORMULA:
                limit index DO ... LOOP
</PRE>

        <P> Here is what happens inside a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT>...<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT>:
        <P> First <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT><IMG SRC="footnote.gif" ALT="half-brother of the DODO bird.">
            puts the index and the limit on the loop control stack.
        <P> <CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0"> 
              <TR> <TD> <IMG SRC="dodoleft.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT  ALT="dodo pushing">
                   <TD> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                   <TD> <IMG SRC="dodoright.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="dodo finished"> 
            </TABLE></CENTER>
        <P> <CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="50%" BORDER="0">
            <TR><TD>Then execution proceeds<BR> to the words inside the loop,
                <TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <TD>up till the word <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT>.
            </TABLE></CENTER>   
        <P> <CENTER><IMG SRC="doloop.gif"  ALIGN=MIDDLE  ALT="do execute loop"></CENTER>

	<P> First <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT> adds one to the loop index.  If the loop index is 
	    then equal to ten, it lets execution move on to the next word in the definition.  Otherwise, 
	    <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT> reroutes execution back to <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT>.
        <P> <CENTER><IMG SRC="dolater.gif"  ALIGN=MIDDLE  ALT="exit loop"></CENTER>

        <P> Remember that the Forth word <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">I</FONT> copies the top of the loop control
            stack onto the parameter stack. You can use <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">I</FONT> to get hold of the 
            current value of the <U>index</U> each time around. Consider the definition
<PRE>   
        : DECADE  10 0 DO  I .  LOOP ;
</PRE>
            which executes like this:
<PRE>   
        DECADE<U> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ok </U>
</PRE>
        <P> Of course, you could pick any range of numbers (within the range of -2147483648 to +2147483647):
<PRE>   
        : SAMPLE  -243 -250 DO  I .  LOOP ;
        SAMPLE<U> -250 -249 -248 -247 -246 -245 -244 ok </U>
</PRE>

        <P> Notice that even negative numbers increase by one each time. The limit is always higher than 
            the index.

        <P> You can leave a number on the stack to serve as an argument to something inside a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT>
            loop. For instance,

<PRE>   
        : MULTIPLICATIONS  CR 11 1 DO  DUP I * .  LOOP  DROP ;
</PRE>  
            will produce the following results:
<PRE>   
        7 MULTIPLICATIONS
        <U>7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 ok </U>
</PRE>
        <P> Here we're simply multiplying the current value of the index by seven each time around. Notice
            that we have to <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DUP</FONT> the seven inside the loop so that a copy will
            be available each time and that we have to <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DROP</FONT> it after we come
            out of the loop.

        <P> A compound interest problem gives us the opportunity to demonstrate some trickier stack 
            manipulations inside a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT> loop.

        <P> Given a starting balance, say $1000, and an interest rate, say 6%, let's write a definition to
            compute and print a table like this:

<PRE>   
        1000 6 COMPOUND
        YEAR 1  BALANCE 1060
        YEAR 2  BALANCE 1124
        YEAR 3  BALANCE 1191
                                etc.
</PRE>
            for twenty years.
        <P> First we'll load <TT>R%</TT>, our previously-defined word from Chap. 5, then we'll define
<PRE>   
        : COMPOUND  ( amt int -- )
                CR SWAP 21 1 DO  ." YEAR " I . 3 SPACES
                                 2DUP R% +  DUP ." BALANCE " . CR 
                           LOOP  2DROP ;
</PRE>
        <P> Each time through the loop, we do a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">2DUP</FONT> so that we always
            maintain a running balance and an unchanged interest rate for the next go-round. When we're
            finally done, we <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">2DROP</FONT> them.

<H2>Getting <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IF</FONT> fy</H2>

        <P> The index can also serve as a condition for an <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IF</FONT> statement. In
            this way you can make something special happen on certain passes through the loop but not on 
            others. Here's a simple example:
<PRE>   
        : RECTANGLE  256 0 DO   I 16 MOD 0= IF  CR  THEN
                                ." *"
                         LOOP ;
</PRE>
        <P> RECTANGLE will print 256 stars, and at every sixteenth star it will also perform a 
            carriage return at your terminal. The result should look like this:
<PRE>   
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
        ****************
</PRE>
        <P> And here's an example from the world of nursery rhymes. We'll let you figure this one out.
<PRE>   
        : POEM  CR 11 1 DO  I . ." Little " 
                            I 3 MOD 0= IF ." indians " CR THEN  
                      LOOP
                ." indian boys. " ;
</PRE>

<H2>Nested Loops</H2>
        
        <P> In the last section we defined a word called <TT>MULTIPLICATIONS</TT>, which contains a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT>...<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT>.
            If we wanted to, we could put <TT>MULTIPLICATIONS</TT> inside another <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT>...<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT>, like this:
<PRE>   
        : TABLE  CR 11 1 DO  I MULTIPLICATIONS  LOOP ;
</PRE>
        <P> Now we'll get a multiplication table that looks like this:

<PRE>   
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    
        2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
        3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
                                        etc.
        10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
</PRE>
            because the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">I</FONT> in the outer loop supplies the argument for <TT>MULTIPLICATIONS</TT>.

        <P> You can also nest <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT> loops inside one another all in the same
            definition:
<PRE>   
        : TABLE  CR 11 1 DO   
                            11 1 DO  I J *  5 U.R  LOOP
                    CR LOOP ;
</PRE>
        <IMG SRC="indexlimit.gif"  ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="index limit position">
        <P> Notice this phrase in the inner loop:
<PRE>   I J *
</PRE>
        <P> In Chap. 5 we mentioned that the word <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">J</FONT> copies the third item on
            the loop control stack onto the parameter stack. It so happens that in this case the third item
            on the loop control stack is the index of the <U>outer</U> loop.

        <P> Thus the phrase <TT>"I J *"</TT> multiplies the two indexes to create the value in the table.

        <P> Now what about this phrase?
<PRE>   5 U.R
</PRE>

        <P> This is nothing more than a fancy <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>.</B></FONT> that is used to print numbers
            in table form so that they line up vertically. The five represents the number of spaces we've 
            decided each column in the table should be. The output of the new table will look like this:
<PRE>   
            1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10      
            2    4    6    8   10   12   14   16   18   20
            3    6    9   12   15   18   21   24   27   30   etc.
</PRE>
        <P> Each number takes five spaces, no matter how many digits it contains. (<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">U.R</FONT>
            stands for "<U>unsigned</U> number-print, <U>right</U> justified." The term "unsigned," you may
            recall, means you cannot use it for negative numbers.)

<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">+LOOP</FONT></H2>

        <P> If you want the index to go up by some number other than one each time around, you can use the
            word <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">+LOOP</FONT> instead of <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT>. 
            <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">+LOOP</FONT> expects on the stack the number by which you want the index to 
            change. For example, in the definition
<PRE>   
        : PENTAJUMPS  50 0 DO  I .  5 +LOOP ;
</PRE>
            the index will go up by five each time, with this result:
<PRE>   
        PENTAJUMPS<U> 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ok </U> 
</PRE>
            while in
<PRE>   
        : FALLING  -10 0 DO  I .  -1 +LOOP ;
</PRE>
            the index will go down by one each time, with this result:
<PRE>   
        FALLING<U> 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 ok </U> 
</PRE>
        <P> The argument for <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">+LOOP</FONT>, which is called the "increment," can come
            from anywhere, but it must be put on the stack each time around. Consider this experimental 
            example:
<PRE>   
        : INC-COUNT  DO  I . DUP +LOOP  DROP ;
</PRE>
        <P> There is no increment inside the definition; instead, it will have to be on the stack when 
            <TT>INC-COUNT</TT> is executed, along with the limit and index. Watch this:
        <P> Step up by one:
<PRE>   
        1 5 0 INC-COUNT<U> 0 1 2 3 4 ok </U>
</PRE>
        <P> Step up by two:
<PRE>   
        2 5 0 INC-COUNT<U> 0 2 4 ok </U>
</PRE>
        <P> Step down by three:
<PRE>   
        -3 -10 10 INC-COUNT<U> 10 7 4 1 -2 -5 -8 ok </U>
</PRE>
        <P> Our next example demonstrates an increment that changes each time through the loop.
<PRE>   : DOUBLING   32767 1 DO  I . I +LOOP ;
</PRE>
        <P> Here the index itself is used as the increment (<TT>I +LOOP</TT>), so that starting with one,
            the index doubles each time, like this:
<PRE>   
        DOUBLING
        <U>1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 ok </U>
</PRE>
        <P> <IMG SRC="loophelp.gif"  ALIGN=RIGHT  ALT="infinite loop">
            Notice that in this example we don't ever want the argument for <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">+LOOP</FONT>
            to be zero, because if it were we'd never come out of the loop. We would have created what is
            known as an "infinite loop."
        
        
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT>ing it -- Forth Style</H2>

        <P> There are a few things to remember before you go off and write some <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT>
            loops of your own.
        
        <P> First, keep this simple guide in mind:
        
        <P><CENTER><B>Reasons for termination</B></CENTER>

        <P> Execution makes its exit from a loop when, in going up, the index has <U>reached</U> or <U>passed</U> the limit.
        <P> <CENTER><IMG SRC="reasons.gif" ALT="reasons for termination"></CENTER>
        <P> Or, when in going down, the index has passed the limit--not when it has merely reached it.

        <P> But a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT> loop always executes <U>at least once</U> (this example will
        loop millions of times on a true ANS Forth system, so be prepared):
<PRE>   
        : TEST  100 10 DO  I . -1 +LOOP ;
        TEST<U> 10 9 8 7 ...</U>
</PRE>
        <P> Second, remember that the words <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LOOP</FONT>
            are branching commands and that therefore they can only be executed inside a definition. This means
            that you cannot design/test your loop definitions in "calculator style" unless you simulate the 
            loop yourself.

        <P> Let's see how a fledgling Forth programmer might go about design/testing the definition of 
            <TT>COMPOUND</TT> (from the first section of this chapter). Before adding the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">."</FONT>
            messages, the programmer might begin by jotting down this version on a piece of paper:
<PRE>   
        : COMPOUND  ( amt int -- )
                SWAP 21 1 DO  I . 2DUP R% + DUP . CR LOOP  2DROP ;
</PRE>
        <P> The programmer migh test this version at the terminal, using <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>.</B></FONT>
            or <TT>.S</TT> to check the result of each step. The "conversation" might look like this:
        <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="debug.jpg" ALT="debugging"></CENTER>

<TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0">
        <CAPTION><I>A Handy Hint<BR>How to Clear the Stack</I></CAPTION>
        <TR><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"> Sometimes a beginner will unwittingly write a loop which leaves a whole lot of numbers on the stack. 
        For example
<PRE>   
        : FIVES  100 0 DO  I 5 . LOOP ;
</PRE>
           instead of
<PRE>   
        : FIVES  100 0 DO  I 5 * . LOOP ;
</PRE>
        <P> If you see this happen to anyone (surely it will never happen to you!) and if you see the beginner
            typing in an endless succession of dots to clear the stack, recommend typing in
<PRE>   
        XX
</PRE>
        <P> <TT>XX</TT> is not a Forth word, so the text interpreter will execute the word <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">ABORT"</FONT>, 
            which among other things clears all stacks. The beginner will be endlessly grateful.
</TABLE>


<H2>Indefinite Loops</H2>
        
        <P> While <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DO</FONT> loops are called definite loops, Forth also supports 
            "indefinite" loops. This type of loop will repeat indefinitely or until some event occurs.
            A standard form of indefinite loop is 
<PRE>   BEGIN ... UNTIL
</PRE>
        <P> The <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">BEGIN</FONT>...<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">UNTIL</FONT> loop repeats until a
            condition is "true."

        <P> The useage is
<PRE>   BEGIN xxx f UNTIL
</PRE>
           where "xxx" stands for the words that you want to be repeated, and "f" stands for a flag.
        As long as the flag is zero (false), the loop will continue to loop, but when the flag becomes 
        non-zero (true), the loop will end.
        <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="indefinite.gif"  ALIGN=MIDDLE  ALT="indefinite loop"></CENTER>

        <P> An example of a definition that uses a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">BEGIN</FONT>...<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">UNTIL</FONT>
            statement is one we mentioned earlier, in our washing machine example:
<PRE>   : TILL-FULL  BEGIN ?FULL UNTIL ;
</PRE>
          which we used in the higher-level definition
<PRE>   : FILL  FAUCETS OPEN  TILL-FULL  FAUCETS CLOSE ;
</PRE>
        <P> <TT>?FULL</TT> will be defined to electronically check a switch in the washtub that indicates when
            the water reaches the correct level. It will return zero  if the switch is not activated and a one
            if it is. <TT>TILL-FULL</TT> does nothing but repeatedly make this test over and over (millions of 
            times per second) until the switch is finally activated, at which time execution will come out of
            the loop. Then the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">;</FONT> in <TT>TILL-FULL</TT> will return the flow of 
            execution to the remaining words in <TT>FILL</TT>, and the water faucets will be turned off.

        <P> Sometimes a programmer will deliberately want to create an infinite loop. In Forth, the best way
            is with the form
<PRE>   : BEGIN xxx 0 UNTIL
</PRE>
        <P> The zero supplies a "false" flag to the word <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">UNTIL</FONT>, so the loop will 
            repeat eternally.

        <P> Beginners usually want to avoid infinite loops, because executing one means that they lose
            control of the computer (in the sense that only the words inside the loop are being executed). But
            infinite loops do have their uses. For instance, the text interpreter is part of an infinite 
            loop called <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">QUIT</FONT>, which waits for input, interprets it, executes it,
            prints "ok," then waits for input once again. In most microprocessor-controlled machines, the 
            highest-level definition contains an infinite loop that defines the machine's behavior.

        <P> Another form of indefinite loop is used in this format:
<PRE>   BEGIN xx f WHILE yyy REPEAT
</PRE>
        <P> Here the test occurs halfway through the loop rather than at the end. As long as the test is true,
            the flow of execution continues with the rest of the loop, then returns to the beginning again. If
            the test is false, the loop ends.
        <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="repeat.gif"  ALIGN=MIDDLE  ALT="indefinite loop"></CENTER>

        <P> Notice that the effect of the test is opposite that in the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">BEGIN</FONT>...<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">UNTIL</FONT>
            construction. Here the loop repeats <U>while</U> something is true (rather than <U>until</U> it's true).

        <P> The indefinite loop structures lend themselves best to cases in which you're waiting for some 
            external event to happen, such as the closing of a switch or thermostat, or the setting of a 
            flag by another part of an application that is running simultaneously. So for now, instead of 
            giving examples, we just want you to remember that the indefinite loop structures exist.
          
<H2>The Indefinitely Definite Loop</H2>

        <P> There is a way to write a definite loop so that it stops short of the prescribed limit if a 
            truth condition changes state, by using the word <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LEAVE</FONT>. 
            <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LEAVE</FONT> causes the loop to end immediately.

        <P> Watch how we rewrite our earlier definition of <TT>COMPOUND</TT>. Instead of just letting the
            loop run twenty times, let's get it to quit after twenty times or as soon as our money has doubled,
            whichever occurs first.
        
        <P> We'll simply add this phrase:
<PRE>   2000 > IF  LEAVE  THEN
</PRE>
            like this:
<PRE>   : DOUBLED   
          6 1000 21 1 DO  CR ." YEAR " I 2 U.R
                          2DUP R% +  DUP ."    BALANCE " .
                          DUP 2000 > IF  CR CR ." more than doubled in " 
                                            I . ." years " LEAVE  
                                   THEN
                     LOOP 2DROP ;
</PRE>
            The result will look like this:
<PRE>   DOUBLED
        YEAR  1   BALANCE 1060
        YEAR  2   BALANCE 1124
        YEAR  3   BALANCE 1191
        YEAR  4   BALANCE 1262
        YEAR  5   BALANCE 1338
        YEAR  6   BALANCE 1418
        YEAR  7   BALANCE 1503
        YEAR  8   BALANCE 1593
        YEAR  9   BALANCE 1689
        YEAR 10   BALANCE 1790
        YEAR 11   BALANCE 1897
        YEAR 12   BALANCE 2011

        more than doubled in 12 years ok
</PRE>
        <P> One of the problems at the end of this chapter asks you to rework <TT>DOUBLED</TT>
            so that it expects the parameters of interest and starting balance, and computes by itself the 
            double balance that <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LEAVE</FONT> will try to reach.

<PRE>
        PAGE RECTANGLE

            which will clear the screen before printing the rectangle that we defined earlier in this chapter.
        Or you could put <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">PAGE</FONT> at the beginning of the definition. like this:

        <P> If you don't want the "ok" to appear upon completion of execution, use the word <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">QUIT</FONT>.

<PRE>   
        RECTANGLE QUIT
