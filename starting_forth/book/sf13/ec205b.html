<H2>5. DO-LOOP, CASE</H2>

At runtime, the pair DO-LOOP works just like BEGIN-AGAIN with the following extra's:
<OL>
<LI> <TT>DO ( boundary start_count -- ) </TT>builds a count mechanism.
<LI> Inside the loop the count is accessible with<TT> I</TT>.
<LI> <TT>LOOP </TT>adjusts the count after each iteration.
<LI> <TT>LOOP </TT>falls through when the counter has finished the indicated range.
</OL>
To formulate it precisely: the counter finishes the indicated range when it passes the "fence post"
between 'boundary-minus-1' and 'boundary.' The same goes for positive <em>and</em> negative 
steps in case of<TT> +LOOP</TT>.

<PRE> 
 10 1 DO ...           ( 1 2 .. 9 ready )
  0 0 DO ...           ( 0 1 .. -2 -1 ready ) 
 20 0 DO ...  2 +LOOP  ( 0 2 .. 18 ready )
-10 0 DO ... -1 +LOOP  ( 0 -1 .. -10 ready )
  0 0 DO ... -1 +LOOP  ( 0 ready )
</PRE>

The word<TT> LEAVE </TT>is used to prematurely exit a DO-LOOP:

<PRE>
.. DO .. IF LEAVE THEN .. LOOP aaa
</PRE>

<TT>LEAVE </TT>removes the counter administration and causes a jump to<TT> aaa</TT>, immediately
after<TT> LOOP</TT>.

<P>
DO-LOOP resembles BEGIN-AGAIN even at compile-time. 
That's why it is possible to use<TT> WHILE </TT>to compile a jump out of a DO-LOOP. 
This has its use when the continuation of the conditionally aborted loop differs substantially 
from that of the normal loop:

<PRE>
.. DO .. WHILE LOOP aaa ELSE .. I .. UNLOOP THEN ..
</PRE>

<TT>aaa </TT>is executed when<TT> LOOP </TT>finishes the loop. The part between<TT> ELSE </TT>and<TT> THEN </TT>is used only after the conditional loop exit. 
In most cases there is no way to do this elegantly using<TT> LEAVE </TT>instead. Two remarks: 
<OL>
<LI> In all cases, the counter administration <B>must be removed explictly</B> using<TT> UNLOOP</TT>.
<LI> <TT>I </TT>is usable outside the loop, <B>as long as the counter administration is still intact</B>.
</OL>

<TT>LEAVE </TT>(always) and<TT> LOOP </TT>(after the last pass) implicitly execute<TT> UNLOOP</TT>.

<P>
To finish off, Forth's CASE-construct. Hot debates have accompanied CASE ever since it was first 
proposed. Is it worth all that attention? Some people, including this author, think not. 
Forth has so many constructs available that CASE is actually redundant. Some people feel that CASE is 
only there to let Forth beginners feel at home with a construct they might recognize from their previous 
programming environments (and that this is doing more bad than good).
